# Contributing Guide

Thank you for contributing to the AI-Powered Smart Classroom Scheduling System.

## Branch Rules

- Do NOT commit directly to `main` or `dev`
- Always create a feature branch from `dev`

### Branch naming format
- backend/<feature-name>
- frontend/<feature-name>
- docs/<feature-name>

Examples:
- backend/scheduler-core
- frontend/timetable-view
- docs/api-update

---

## Workflow

1. Checkout `dev`
2. Create a new feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with a clear message
5. Push your branch
6. Create a Pull Request (PR) to `dev`

---

## Commit Messages

Use clear messages:
- "Add timetable generation logic"
- "Fix room capacity validation"
- "Update API documentation"

Avoid:
- "update"
- "fix"
- "changes"

---

## Pull Requests

- One feature per PR
- Follow the PR template
- Wait for review before merging

---

## Communication

- All tasks must be linked to a GitHub Issue
- If you are blocked, comment on the issue
- Do not work on unassigned tasks
